# [Ongoing] Fetching data from Twitter and storing in MYSQL database

Using services of pythonanywhere.com I created a MySQL database.<br>
Created a table "tweeto" with time, username and tweet columns and storing it in database<br>
Target is to fetch details from Twitter and currently store them to analyze them later for other purposes.<br>

* twitertosqldb.py file currently fetches data from twitter using their API and searching for keyword "game of thrones" and storing the tweets matching this keyword into database.
